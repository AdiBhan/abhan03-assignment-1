# Assignment 1 - Data Collection and Analysis

## Objective

In this assignment, you as a class will collectively record a dataset with elevator arrival times on the ground floor in CDS.
Using this dataset, you will determine the best location to wait in order to minimize the expected walking distance to the next arriving elevator.

Learning goals:

- Practice collecting, interacting, and visualizing data.
- Practice making a hypothesis based on training data and then evaluating it on test data.

This assignment will be graded on a scale of full credit, partial credit, or no credit. You will get full credit if you collected data, proposed a reasonable location to wait for elevators at, and tested the proposed location on the data to see that it works. The questions are meant to guide you.
